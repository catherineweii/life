<p>[Spoken introduction:]</p>
<p>I was in the winter of my life, and the men I met along the road were my only summer.<br>At night I fell asleep with visions of myself, dancing and laughing and crying with them.<br>Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour, and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me, and my only real happy times.<br>I was a singer. Not a very popular one,<br>I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet, but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken.<br>But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted, and then losing it to know what true freedom is.<br>When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I’d been living, they asked me “Why?”, but there’s no use in talking to people who have home.<br>They have no idea what it’s like to seek safety in other people, for home to be wherever you lay your head.<br>I was always an unusual girl.<br>My mother told me I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing due north, no fixed personality; just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean…<br>And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying…<br>Because I was born to be the other woman.<br>Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone.<br>Who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it, and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me.</p>
<p>I’ve been out on that open road<br>You can be my full time daddy,<br>White and gold<br>Singing blues has been getting old<br>You can be my full-time baby,<br>Hot or cold</p>
<p>Don’t break me down<br>I’ve been travelin’ too long<br>I’ve been trying too hard<br>With one pretty song</p>
<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze,<br>I drive fast, I am alone in midnight<br>Been tryin’ hard not to get into trouble,<br>But I, I’ve got a war in my mind<br>So, I just ride, just ride,<br>I just ride, just ride</p>
<p>Dying young and I’m playing hard<br>That’s the way my father made his life an art<br>Drink all day and we talk ‘til dark<br>That’s the way the road dogs do it: ride ‘til dark.</p>
<p>Don’t leave me now<br>Don’t say good-bye<br>Don’t turn around<br>Leave me high and dry</p>
<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze,<br>I drive fast, I am alone in midnight<br>Been tryin’ hard not to get into trouble,<br>But I, I’ve got a war in my mind<br>I just ride, just ride,<br>I just ride, just ride</p>
<p>I’m tired of feeling like I’m fucking crazy<br>I’m tired of driving ‘til I see stars in my eyes<br>All I’ve got to keep myself sane, baby<br>So I just ride, I just ride</p>
<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze,<br>I drive fast, I am alone in midnight<br>Been tryin’ hard not to get into trouble,<br>But I, I’ve got a war in my mind<br>I just ride, just ride,<br>I just ride, I just ride</p>
<p>[Spoken ending:]</p>
<p>Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people, and finally I did on the open road.<br>We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore, except to make our lives into a work of art.<br>Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun.<br>I believe in the country America used to be.<br>I believe in the person I want to become.<br>I believe in the freedom of the open road.<br>And my motto is the same as ever:<br>“I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I’m at war with myself I ride, I just ride.”<br>Who are you?<br>Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?<br>Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?<br>I have. I am fucking crazy.<br>But I am free.</p>
